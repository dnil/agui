INSTALLING A GUI

Thank you for chosing A GUI for your genome project. The program has only
seen limited portability testing and use outside our lab to date, so
feedback will be warmly appreciated. Don't let this discourage you -
once set up, A GUI is a useful tool for genome analysis and
annotation.

If the program is used in the production and analysis of data published in a 
scientific journal, please cite

D Nilsson and B Andersson, "A Graphical User Interface for Parasite Genome Annotation", Computer
Methods and Programs in Biomedicine", 2002, in press

For detailed user instructions, please refer to the users guide
(doc/userguide.ps or doc/userguide.pdf). For details on the program and
algorithms used, please refer to D Nilsson and B Andersson, "A
Graphical User Interface for Parasite Genome Annotation", Computer
Methods and Programs in Biomedicine (available as an electronic
pre-print).

* Dependencies

The program depends on perl, perlTK and bioperl, and 
uses Glimmer2, NCBI BLAST and WU-BLAST among others.
